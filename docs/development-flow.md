# Development Flow

This document defines the default development flow for three-webmcp, with particular emphasis on AI-assisted development.

## 1. Start with an Issue

Work should begin with an Issue.

The Issue should clearly state:

- the problem
- the expected outcome
- relevant context

The Issue defines the scope of the work. If the scope is unclear, clarify the Issue before implementation instead of inventing requirements during the change.

## 2. Create a Pull Request for the Issue

Implementation should be proposed through a Pull Request associated with the Issue.

The Pull Request should explain:

- what changed
- what outcome the change produces
- how the change was validated
- which Issue it addresses

A Pull Request should only claim to close an Issue when it fully addresses that Issue.

If the Pull Request intentionally implements only part of the Issue, it should state that clearly and should not present the Issue as fully resolved.

## 3. Review Before Merge

Every Pull Request should be reviewed before merge.

A central review question is:

> Does this Pull Request address the Issue completely, without adding changes that are not justified by the Issue?

Review must check both directions:

- **No missing scope:** the Pull Request should not leave required parts of the Issue unresolved while claiming completion.
- **No unnecessary scope:** the Pull Request should not introduce unrelated abstractions, frameworks, policies, or complexity beyond what is needed to solve the Issue.

This is especially important for AI-generated changes. AI agents may produce broader or more elaborate designs than the task requires. Prefer the smallest change that fully satisfies the Issue.

## 4. Revise Until Review Passes

If review finds missing requirements, unnecessary scope, correctness problems, or insufficient validation, update the Pull Request and review it again.

The Pull Request should be merged only when the reviewed change is an appropriate and complete response to the Issue.

## 5. Merge

After review passes, merge the Pull Request.

The normal flow is therefore:

```text
Issue

Implementation
  ↓
Pull Request
  ↓
Review

Revision if needed

```
